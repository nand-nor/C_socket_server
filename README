Assignment 1: HTTP Server
Due: 11:59 PM, Feb 5th

In this assignment, I wrote a simple web server that understands the
HTTP protocol and responds to basic GET requests. Per the assignment
specification, the server will respond to two URLs: one which returns
a JSON dictionary describing IP addresses and the corresponding
locations of recent connections to the page, and one which displays some
very basic information about me. I have employed rate limiting to
prevent users from overwhelming the server. These web pages do not 
correspond to files, but are constructed by the program in response
to each request. The server handles one client at a time and per the 
assignment specification should never quit (unless some error is 
encountered).

Requirements of the program: Takes one command line argument:
A port number on which to listen for requests.
Accepts TCP requests from web browsers/clients and responds with a 
single page of content based on the URL:
1. The main page (/): A valid JSON list of the most recent 10 
IP addresses that accessed it. Each IP address is associated with 
the number of times the main page has been accessed from that 
specific address and the city where that IP originated from.
2. Another version of the main page (/): This is the page that appears
if a user is being rate limited.  It contains a simple warning 
message
3. An about page (about.html): A sentence or two about me
Returns a proper HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found as the HTTP response if a 
URL other than "/" or "about.html" is requested.

The requirement for the main page is satisfied by keeping records in
the server about the identities of the addresses that send requests. Per 
the assignment specifications, this is done in memory.

For more details on how students were instructed to implement this 
server, see COMP112_A1_Spring2018.pdf.
